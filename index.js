/**
Challenge: 

Part 2: 
- Add a `header` element with a nested `nav` element. Inside the `nav`,
  include a `img` element with the image of the React logo inside
  (src="./react-logo.png") and make sure to set the width to something
  more manageable so it doesn't take up the whole screen
- Add an `h1` with some text describing the page. (E.g. "Reasons
  I'm excited to learn React"). Place it above the ordered list.
- Add a `footer` after the list that says: 
    "© 20xx <last name here> development. All rights reserved."
 */

    /**
Mini Challenge:
Move the `header` element from Page into 
its own component called "Header"
*/

    /**
Challenge: 

- Move the `footer` into its own component called "Footer" 
  and render that component inside the Page component.
- Move the `h1` and `ol` together into another component
  called "MainContent" and render inside Page as well.
